Suppose you are working on a video game that involves several types of characters, including wizards, warriors, and archers.
Each character has a name, a health level, a damage level, and a special ability.
The wizards can cast spells, the warriors can block attacks, and the archers can shoot arrows.

You have been tasked with implementing a factory method to create these characters.
